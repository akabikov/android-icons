## General info
I suddenly realized that the icons in modern interfaces are not intuitive for some people.
I wanted to find some kind of reference on the icons that are used in the Android interface, but I still could not find anything sensible. Then I decided to make this small guide and at the same time practice  JS and CSS.

## Demo
You can view online demo here: https://akabikov.github.io/android-icons/

## Technologies
* Vanilla JS
* CSS Grid

## Third-party resources
* [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/)

## Setup and using
Clone or download repository and start your local server in project directory.

You can edit descriptions and add your own icons to the `content.json` file.

## Inspiration
This little guide is made for my girlfriend's grandparents.
